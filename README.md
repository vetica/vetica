### About me

When I started college, I was going to be a journalist. My first AP style class, however, suggested that words were not the route I was destined for.

I switched my focus to design and found I could still tell great stories through visuals.

Throughout my career, I’ve had a lot of amazing opportunities to make an impact through design. While working for the Las Vegas Sun, I resigned the business newspaper into a magazine that reflected the life of Vegas. When I joined Gannett, I moved the Cincinnati Enquirer from a broadsheet to a compact, which allowed for new, dynamic storytelling in print.

The world of digital storytelling has been even more rewarding because I’m not restricted to what can physically be printed. I’ve been able to ask – “what features will tell this story better?” This has led to new features like video pull quotes, glossary modules and recirculation carousels to enhance reader experience and find new ways to tell great stories.

I always love to talk design, so reach out and start a conversation.
